Big Shoulders is a family of condensed American Gothic typefaces, created for the city and citizens of Chicago. The family’s tall, sans-serif forms honor Chicago’s multiple histories as railway transport hub, public political action center, and the birthplace of House music.

Big Shoulders [Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Big+Shoulders+Display) and [Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Big+Shoulders+Text) is hosted on Google Fonts, and on [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/big-shoulders).

## Build Instructions

The main source is `Big Shoulders.glyphs`. Any changes made there need to also be reflected in `Big Shoulders Flat.glyphs`.

`Big Shoulders Flat.glyphs` is a throwaway source needed to generate correct static instances using `fontmake`, as the current stable `fontmake` (as of August 2019) can’t deal with brace layers when generating instances. 

To generate `Big Shoulders Flat.glyphs`, apply [this Glyphs script](https://github.com/yanone/Yanone-GlyphsApp-Scripts/blob/master/Interpolation/Expand%20Intermediate%20Masters.py) to `Big Shoulders.glyphs` and save under new name. Repeat for any change to `Big Shoulders.glyphs`.

Once `fontmake` version 2.0 is stable and out, which can deal with brace layers, the use of `Big Shoulders Flat.glyphs` can be discarded.

Build fonts using `build.sh`.
