Big Shoulders is a superfamily of condensed American Gothic variable fonts, created for the Chicago Design System, as well as the citizens of Chicago. The family&apos;s tall, sans-serif forms are based in Chicago&apos;s multiple histories in railway transport, public political action, and dance.

## Build Instructions

The Big Shoulders superfamily is composed by Big Shoulders, Big Shoulders Display, and Big Shoulders Inline.

The source files can be found in the `sources` folder under the directory for each subfamily

```
    Big-Shoulders/sources
    Big-Shoulders-Stencil/sources
    Big-Shoulders-Inline/sources
```

The families are built using fontmake and gftools post processing script. Tools are all python based.

To install all the Python tools, first create a virtualenv. This step should be done only once:

```

# create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv

# activate the venv
    source venv/bin/activate

# install the required dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Once the virtual environment is activated, run the build script that is on each subfamily folder in the terminal, e.g.:

```
cd Big-Shoulders
cd sources
sh build-B.sh
```

tweaked angled accents (grave, acute, double grave, Hungarian umlaut, circumflex, ) to be steeper and shorter so that lowercase characters can pack tighter together.
